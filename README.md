### About us:
This work is part of the [Harmonize Project](https://www.bsc.es/research-and-development/projects/harmonize-harmonizing-multi-scale-spatiotemporal-data-health). Harmonizing multi-scale spatiotemporal data for health in climate change hotspots. Harmonize is a project in partnership with the Health and Climate Observatory and several international partners, including the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). The projectâ€™s objective is to collect, organize and analyze multi-scale spatiotemporal data for health in climate hotspots. 

The Earth Observation Data Cube tuned for Health Response Systems (EODCtHRS) component is based on the integration and interoperability between specific sets of attention data (climate reanalysis, forecast, socioeconomic, demographic, health, disease surveillance data and drone images) and digital infrastructure of the Brazil Data Cube (BDC) Project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), in particular with the Earth Observation datasets of Brazil. I am working on this project as part of the development team in the integration between BDC and climate and weather data.

This work is supported by the Wellcome Trust grant number 224694/Z/21/Z.
